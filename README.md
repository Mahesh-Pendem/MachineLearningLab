# 📊 Machine Learning Lab

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Lab** repository!  
This repo contains all practical implementations and exercises done as part of our Machine Learning lab coursework.  
Each lab demonstrates key concepts in ML using **Python** and essential libraries like:

- pandas for data manipulation  
- numpy for numerical operations  
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization  
- scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
