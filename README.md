# 📊 Machine Learning Lab

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Lab** repository!  
This repository contains all practical implementations, experiments, and exercises done as part of our Machine Learning lab coursework.

Each lab explores key concepts in Machine Learning using **Python** and essential libraries like:

- `pandas` — for data manipulation
- `numpy` — for numerical computing
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` — for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` — for building machine learning models
