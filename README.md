# ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Lab

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Lab** repository! This repo contains all practical implementations and exercises done as part of our Machine Learning lab coursework.

-   **Name:** Mahesh Pendem
-   **ID:** B200737
-   **Class:** CSE-C3

Each lab demonstrates key concepts in ML using **Python** and essential libraries like:

-   `pandas` for data manipulation
-   `numpy` for numerical operations
-   `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
-   `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run the lab notebooks, you need Python and the required libraries. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

### 1. Create a `requirements.txt` file
Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project root and add the following lines to it:

```txt
# Data Manipulation & Numerical Operations
numpy
pandas

# Data Visualization
matplotlib
seaborn

# Machine Learning
scikit-learn

# Jupyter Environment
jupyter
